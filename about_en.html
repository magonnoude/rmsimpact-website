                        <p><strong>RMS Impact</strong> is an initiative of <strong>RMS International Group</strong> designed to provide an integrated solution to the challenges of accessing essential services in rural Africa. By combining access to the Internet, electricity, and drinking water, we create an ecosystem conducive to economic and social development.</p>
                        <p>Our approach is based on a <strong>Public-Private Partnership (PPP)</strong> model, where we work closely with governments to obtain logistical support and tax exemptions, while we mobilize investments and manage the design, installation, and maintenance of the infrastructure.</p>
